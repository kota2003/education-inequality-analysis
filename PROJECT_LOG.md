## 2026-04-23 — Phase 00, Project Kickoff

**Context:** Project 4 of the data science portfolio. Initial scope (v1) proposed a cross-country regression of Gini on education enrolment, with a five-phase plan. The scope was reviewed against the bar expected of a Data Scientist portfolio and found to be too narrow (single method, limited variables, no machine learning component, no explicit handling of panel structure).

**Decision:** Adopted Scope v2, which restructures the project around a three-layer analytical framework:

- Layer A — Descriptive (EDA, geographic visualisation, country clustering)
- Layer B — Explanatory (Pooled OLS → Fixed Effects → Random Effects + Hausman test, clustered standard errors)
- Layer C — Predictive (Random Forest / Gradient Boosting, SHAP interpretability)

Phase count expanded from 5 to 7 to accommodate the added clustering (Phase 04) and predictive modelling (Phase 06) layers. Data coverage expanded to all available countries, 1990–2023. Variable set expanded to include mean years of schooling, gender-disaggregated enrolment, education expenditure, and additional structural controls (urbanisation, trade openness, industry shares).

**Rationale:**

- A DS portfolio must demonstrate both statistical inference and machine learning; a single-method project cannot do this.
- Panel data demands panel methods; Pooled OLS alone would be a technical weakness visible to any reviewer with econometrics background.
- Wider data coverage enables fixed-effects estimation (which needs within-country variation over time) and supports ML models that require sufficient sample size.
- Explicit out-of-scope statements (IV, DiD, deep learning) prevent scope creep while demonstrating awareness of methodological alternatives.

**Impact:**

- Project duration extended; expect ~7 chat sessions (one per phase).
- Tech stack expanded: added `linearmodels`, `xgboost`, `shap`, `pycountry`, `wbdata`.
- Success criteria rewritten to be measurable across technical, analytical, and portfolio dimensions.
- Scope v2 placed at `docs/project_scope.md` as the canonical living specification.

## 2026-04-23 — Phase 00, Environment Setup

**Context:** Repository cloned from GitHub as an empty project. Required a reproducible Python environment with pinned dependencies, isolated from prior projects' environments.

**Decision:**

- Created a dedicated conda environment `p4_education` with Python 3.11.15.
- Installed the full Scope v2 dependency set (pandas, numpy, statsmodels, linearmodels, scikit-learn, xgboost, shap, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, wbdata, pycountry, jupyter, ipykernel).
- Pinned all installed versions via `pip freeze > requirements.txt` to guarantee reproducibility.
- Registered `p4_education` as a Jupyter kernel for use in notebooks.
- Established the standard project directory layout per `PROJECT_WORKFLOW.md` §6.
- Configured `.gitignore` to exclude raw data, virtual environment folders, phase summaries, and OS/IDE artefacts, while preserving directory structure via `.gitkeep` placeholders.

**Rationale:**

- A dedicated environment per project is a baseline reproducibility requirement for a portfolio repository that reviewers may clone.
- Conda was chosen over `venv` for consistency with prior projects in this workspace and because Anaconda is already the user's primary Python distribution.
- Version pinning via `pip freeze` captures not just declared dependencies but transitive ones, eliminating "works on my machine" failures.

**Impact:**

- All subsequent phases run inside `p4_education`. Do not install additional packages globally.
- Any new library introduced in later phases must be followed by `pip freeze > requirements.txt` and a commit noting the addition.
- `data/raw/` contents are gitignored; raw data acquisition scripts (Phase 01) must be fully re-runnable from the scripts themselves so that a fresh clone can reproduce the raw layer.

## 2026-04-23 — Phase 01, Step 01

**Context:** Drafted `data/raw/manifest.yaml` declaring 3 data sources (World Bank WDI, World Bank country metadata, UNDP HDR) and 18 World Bank indicators. Built `scripts/phase01_s01_design_manifest.py` to structurally validate the manifest and probe each WB indicator code against the World Bank REST API (`/v2/indicator/{code}?format=json`).

**Decision:** Accept Step 01 as complete with 17/18 indicators API-verified and 1 (`SE.SEC.ENRR.MA`) externally verified via the official WB data portal (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.SEC.ENRR.MA — confirmed live, 1970–2025 coverage, sourced from UNESCO UIS, last published 2026-02). Retry logic (3 attempts, 20s timeout, exponential backoff) resolved 2 of the initial 3 transient timeouts; the remaining one is a route-specific network quirk rather than a code validity issue.

**Rationale:** The purpose of Step 01 is to catch code typos and renames before Step 02 bulk downloads. All 18 codes are confirmed current. Extending retry budgets further would only chase network variance without new information. Step 02's actual download attempt serves as the authoritative test.

**Impact:** Manifest is finalised for Step 02 consumption. Validation report saved at `outputs/tables/phase01_s01_manifest_validation.csv`. No changes to `requirements.txt`. If `SE.SEC.ENRR.MA` fails to download in Step 02, we will revisit with concrete failure information.
